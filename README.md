# Neon Bootstrap

Project ready to use with neon and all the elemental stack.

# Provisioning public assets

Neon works in node and in the browser, just copy to your
assets/js/vendor folder by running `node bin/copy_neon.js` or copy anywhere
else by running `node bin/copy_neon.js new/destination`

This way you public neon is always in sync with your package. Use it in
build tasks too.
